## General Information

I built this project to further familiarise myself with React hooks, such as `useState` and `useReducer`. Furthermore, I have learnt more about custom hooks; I created a custom hook for keyboard shortcuts.

## Features

- Peform common mathematical functions
- Clear the caclulator output (AC)
- Delete one digit from the calculator output (DEL)
- View the calculation history
- Select calculations from the history
- Keyboard shortcuts for every button on the calculator

## Setup

1. Run `npm install`.
2. Run `npm start`.

## Acknowledgements

I used [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgRrrOt0Vr8) tutorial from Web Dev Simplified, and then expanded on it with new features, such as the calculator history.
